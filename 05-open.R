ggplot(data = collatz_df ,
       mapping =  aes( x = length,

# With the visualisation of the boxplot, we can see that although both
# boxplot are right skewed, it is evident that Odd numbers have a higher
# average length than Even numbers. Also, Odd numbers have a few outlier
# unlike Even numbers, where Even numbers has no outlier.
